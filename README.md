In promotion of manned spaceflight returning to US soil on 27 May 2020, SpaceX and NASA released a docking simulator of the SpaceX's Dragon 2 capsule docking with the ISS. 

This process will be automated in the actual launch but the astronauts can always take manual control in case of emergencies.

I wrote a JSON script to dock automatically. 

In order to run the script yourself, press Ctrl+Shift+J in your browser and paste the json file in the code editor.

Have fun! :P
